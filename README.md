- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Deanne â€“ a former nurse turned software developer, passionate about creating solutions that blend technology and real-world problem-solving.
  
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently focused on full-stack development with JavaScript, React, Java, and Spring Boot, but Iâ€™m always looking to expand my knowledge of new technologies!

- ðŸŒ± I love learning and tackling challenges, from frontend design to backend logic. I bring a unique perspective to tech, thanks to my background in healthcare, where precision and adaptability are key.

- ðŸš€ Let's connect! Iâ€™m open to collaborations, learning opportunities, and innovative projects where I can contribute and grow.

- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:deannechae@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deannechae/)!

- âœ¨ Fun fact: My username skyoon26 stands for Suekyung (my Korean name), Yoon (my husband's last name), and the number 26 (my birthday)!
