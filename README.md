## About Me: üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
I'm **Deanne**‚Äîa nurse (RN, BSN) turned full-stack developer.
Though I initially pursued a practical career in healthcare, my love for technology (Xanga, anyone?) has always been a constant. Transitioning into software development has been one of the best decisions I've ever made.

As a **LaunchCode** graduate, I've built on my foundation in programming and am diving into more complex topics while building new projects. I'm excited to join a collaborative team where I can contribute, learn, and continue growing as a software engineer.
